# Hello there, It's Parham
I'm an aspiring Web developer based in Tehran, currently trying to break into tech in my early 20s.

## My Tech stack includes :
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,js,react,nodejs,mongodb,expressjs)](https://skillicons.dev)

### Miscellaneous 

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=tailwind,figma,git,github)](https://skillicons.dev)

I have no intention of adding new technologies for now and instead want to go as deep as possible in what I already know, this way I can provide more value than spreading myself too thin across multiple trades.
